Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

With the Standard Prepayment Model, these calculations will generally require an iterative
trial-and-error procedure, even for a single pool; the aggregate PSA speed should not be
computed as a weighted average of individual pool speeds. Likewise, it is generally not accurate to apply an average prepayment speed to a hypothetical single pool having the aggregate
WAC and WAM of the pools to be analyzed. At best, these calculations can provide a first
iteration toward the correct value. Average prepayment rates that do not meet the precise
specifications of the preceding paragraphs should be acknowledged as nonstandard approximations.
Iteration is not necessary for computing average prepayment rates in terms of SMM or CPR.
Instead, one should sum the scheduled balances for the loans at the end of the period, computed as if there were no prepayments during the period. The average prepayment rate for
the aggregation is then

Finally, for the special case in which all the mortgages in the sample being considered are
fully seasoned at the start of the period, even the aggregate PSA speed can be computed
without iteration:
PSA avg = 100 *
