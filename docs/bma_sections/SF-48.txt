Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

However, Mortgage Yield should not be used in the duration or convexity formulas
below, where Y refers strictly to Semiannual Yield.
c.

Average Life is the dollar-weighted average time to receive future payments of principal
(PRK), where again the TK’s measure the time elapsed from the settlement date to the
actual receipt of the cash flows:
Average Life =

T1 PR 1 + T2 PR 2 + ...
PR 1 + PR 2 + ... .

The precise definition of principal payments for accrual instruments (CMO Z-bonds,
GPMs and certain ARMs) is the subject of Section H.1.
d.

Macaulay Duration, or simply Duration, is the PV-weighted average time to receive future
payments:
Duration =

Modified Duration represents the ratio of a small percentage increase in price to the
accompanying decrease in Semiannual Yield, assuming cash flows are held fixed. It is
calculated by dividing the Macaulay Duration by the appropriate semiannual compounding factor:
Modified Duration =

Duration
1 + Y 200 .

Modified Duration should not be called simply Duration, to avoid confusion between the
two concepts.
f.

Convexity is a measure of the decrease in price-sensitivity of a security per unit increase
in yield. More precisely, convexity equals the price of the security, differentiated twice
with respect to Semiannual Yield, divided by the price. Assuming fixed cash flows (no
prepayment variability), then
Cash-Flow Convexity =

 T1 (T1 + 1 2) CF1

Convexity may be divided by 100 for purposes of expression.

For securities with fixed cash flows, Modified Duration and Cash-Flow Convexity can be
used to approximate the price/yield relationship according to the formula
