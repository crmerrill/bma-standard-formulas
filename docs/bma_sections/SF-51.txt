Example: If the same Ginnie Mae I 9.0% pass-through (360-month term, 150% PSA) is
purchased at par, but for settlement seven days after the issue date, then the 360 cash
flows are the same as in the previous example, but now (with accrued interest)

2. Calculations for Floating-Rate MBS
Definitions follow for two of the most common measures of the value of a floating-rate
security: Yield-to-Maturity Spread (YTM Spread) and Discounted Margin (DM). The consistency of calendar assumptions is particularly important for these calculations.
a.

The YTM Spread is the difference between (1) the yield of a floating-rate security and
(2) the yield of the index rate itself, assuming in both cases that the index rate takes on a
certain fixed value for the indefinite future. (Unless otherwise specified, this should be
the current level of the index rate.)
(1)

Cash flows for the floater are computed strictly according to the specifics of the
security (calendar basis, accrued interest, payment delay, reset frequency, reset
margin, caps, floors, prepayment rates, etc.). The cash-flow yield of the floater is
computed on a 30/360 Bond-Equivalent basis (as specified in Section G.1.) or else
on an ACTUAL/360 Money-Market basis (following the same yield formula but
defining the exponents TK according to ACTUAL/360 calendar accounting).
Ordinarily, the TK will be computed on the same calendar basis as the cash flows.
However, it is sometimes necessary to compare two securities whose cash flows are
determined by different calendar bases. The TK must be computed on the same
calendar basis for both. Quotations should always specify which calendar basis is
being used.

(2)

The cash-flow yield of the benchmark index is simply the index itself, converted if
necessary to a 30/360 Bond-Equivalent basis or an ACTUAL/360 Money-Market
basis, depending on the basis used to compute the cash-flow yield of the floater in
(1) above. To convert ACTUAL/360 yields to 30/360 yields (or vice versa), the
index rate should be multiplied (or divided, as appropriate) by a gross-up factor
of 365/360. No gross-up conversion is necessary between ACTUAL/ACTUAL and
30/360 yields. After converting the index rate to the desired calendar basis (30/360
or ACTUAL/360), index rates expressed on a monthly, quarterly or annual compounding basis should be converted to semiannual compounding.
Calendar conventions for the most common reset indexes are as follows:
