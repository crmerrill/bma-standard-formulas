Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

A. Computational Accuracy
Many common calculations for mortgage-related securities (yields, durations, prepayment rates,
etc.) require the calculation of a large number of intermediate quantities (cash flows, principal
balances, etc.). All intermediate calculations should be carried out to their full precision, preserving at least ten significant digits of accuracy. This will generally require double-precision computer arithmetic. The only quantities that should be assigned an integer variable type are those
that represent whole numbers of days, months or years.
Only when all computations are complete should the final values be rounded for display. Results
may be shown to any desired number of decimal places, provided that the last digit presented has
been obtained by rounding and not by truncating the complete figure.
The numerical examples that appear throughout the document are intended to provide simple
checks against improper implementation of the Standard Formulas, not an exhaustive set of
benchmarks that would guarantee conformance.
