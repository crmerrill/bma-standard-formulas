B. Prepayments
1. Cash Flows
For a level-payment fixed-rate mortgage pool with gross weighted-average coupon C%, current weighted-average remaining term M months, and M0-M months elapsed since origination, the amortized loan balance (as a fraction of par) is
BAL =

1 – (1 + C 1200)
1 – (1 + C 1200)

−M

−M 0

and the scheduled gross monthly payment (also as a fraction of par) is
GROSS MORTGAGE PAYMENT = PRINCIPAL + INTEREST
= ( BAL1 − BAL 2 ) + ( BAL1 * C 1200)
=

C 1200
1 – (1 + C 1200) −M 0 .

The net payment passed through to investors consists of the scheduled gross payment above,
plus unscheduled prepayments, minus a servicing fee of BAL1 * S/1200, where the servicing
percentage (S) is the difference between the gross coupon (C) and the net pass-through
coupon of the security.
The pool factor (F) expresses the principal remaining in the pool each month as a fraction of
the original face amount. The survival factor (F/BAL) represents the fraction of $1.00 unit
loans remaining in the pool from those originally present at issuance:

POOL FACTOR = SURVIVAL FACTOR * AMORTIZED LOAN BALANCE.
By convention, mortgage-related security analysis assumes that all prepayments are whole
prepayments on $1.00 unit loans within the pool.
The cash flows of more complex mortgage securities (CMO bonds, Graduated-Payment
Mortgages, Adjustable-Rate Mortgages, etc.) are governed by specific contractual features
not addressed here.
Example: A mortgage pass-through is issued with a net coupon of 9.0%, a gross coupon of
9.5% and a term of 360 months. If prepayments for the first month are 0.00025022 (as a
fraction of par), then the first cash flow paid to investors will consist of the following
components:
(1) Scheduled Amortization

=

0.00049188,

(2) Unscheduled Prepayments =

0.00025022,

(3) Gross Mortgage Interest

=

0.00791667,

(4) Servicing Fee

=

0.00041667,
