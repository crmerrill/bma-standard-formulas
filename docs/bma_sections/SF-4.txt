2. Mortgage Prepayment Models
The prepayment rate of a mortgage pool may be expressed in a number of different ways.
These measures are equally valid, although a particular method may be more useful in a
given instance.
a.

The SMM (Single Monthly Mortality) rate of a mortgage pool is the percentage of the
mortgage loans outstanding at the beginning of a month assumed to terminate during
the month. That is, if in some month the initial and final pool factors are F1 and F2,
respectively (as fractions of the original face amount), and the amortized loan balances
are BAL1 and BAL2 (as fractions of par), then
 BAL 2   SMM 
F2 = F1 * 

 * 1 −
100  .
 BAL1  

An equivalent means of specifying a one-month prepayment rate is to separate the factor drop for the month (F1–F2) into scheduled and unscheduled principal payments. If
there were no unscheduled prepayments during the month, then the factor for the end
of the month would have been

Fsched = F1

BAL 2
BAL1 .

The quantity F1–Fsched represents amortization for the month, and Fsched–F2 represents
early prepayment of principal. The one-month prepayment rate can then be defined as

SMM = 100

Fsched − F2
Fsched .
