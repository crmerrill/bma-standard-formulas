AM DEF(i)

Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

= Amortization from Defaults
If P&I are advanced:
= (NEW DEF(i) + FCL(i–1) – ADB(i)) * [1–SCH AM(i)/SCH AM(i–1)]
or if P&I are not advanced:
=0

ACT AM(i)

= Actual Amortization
= (PERF BAL(i–1) – NEW DEF(i)) * [1 – SCH AM(i)/SCH AM(i–1)]

EXP INT(i)

= Expected Interest
= (PERF BAL(i–1) + FCL(i–1)) * Net Mortgage Rate

LOST INT(i)

= Interest Lost
= (NEW DEF(i) + FCL(i–1)) * Net Mortgage Rate

ACT INT(i)

= Actual Interest
= EXP INT(i) – LOST INT(i) = (PERF BAL(i–1) – NEW DEF(i))

* Net Mortgage Rate
PRIN RECOV(i) = Principal Recovery
= MAX [ADB(i) – PRIN LOSS(i) ; 0]
PRIN LOSS(i)

= Principal Loss
= MIN [NEW DEF(i – months until recovery) * Severity Rate ; ADB(i)]

ADB(i)

= Amortized Default Balance in Recovery Month
If P&I are advanced:
= NEW DEF(i – months until recovery)

* [SCH AM(i–1)/SCH AM(i–1–months until recovery)]
or if P&I are not advanced:
= NEW DEF(i – months until recovery) * 1
MDR(i)
