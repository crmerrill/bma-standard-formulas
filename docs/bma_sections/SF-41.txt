Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

If there is a dispersion of loan terms within a given pool, the CAGE calculation will give a
loan age estimate that is too long.
If the original WAM of the loans is not available, the average loan age should be estimated as
the average original maturity of the loans minus the remaining WAM; if the remaining WAM
is not available, the average loan age should be estimated as the average original maturity of
the loans minus time to final maturity.
As noted in Section B, the Standard Prepayment Model of The Bond Market Association and
the ABS model both specify prepayment percentages based on the age of the underlying
loans, not the age of the pool itself. The age of the pool should only be used if there is insufficient information to estimate loan age by any of the above-mentioned methods, subject to
the exception noted below. All WAMs and ages should be rounded to the nearest full month
for use in calculations.
The examples that follow illustrate the determination of WAM and age for selected Freddie
Mac GOLD, Freddie Mac 75-day, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae pools.

WAM used with factor of 0.9708674 is 342 months (as reported on quartile tape).
Age used with factor of 0.9708674 is seven months (as reported on quartile tape).
WAM used with factor of 0.9785748 is 343 months (increment the most recently available
WAM by one month).
Age used with factor of 0.9785748 is six months (decrement the most recently available age
by one month).
The one-month PSA rate is 604. The value used for MONTH in the PSA formula is 7.

* Prior to March 1993, the WAMs reported on Freddie Mac’s quartile tape were for the prior month, although the factor reported on
the GOLD factor tape reflected scheduled principal advanced through the current settlement month. This made it necessary to
decrement the GOLD quartile tape WAM by one month to calculate the prepayment rate. As of March 1993, this calculation will
have already been incorporated in the Freddie Mac quartile tape, so no adjustment is necessary.
