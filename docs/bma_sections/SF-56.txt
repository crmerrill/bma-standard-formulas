Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

Long-standing market practices have resulted in different methods for calculating average life
for pass-through securities (notably GPMs and payment-capped ARMs) and for CMOs.
Because of widespread acceptance of these methods within their respective market segments,
the Standard Formulas for average life are product-specific.
For GPMs and ARMs, all periodic principal payments, positive or negative, should be included in both the numerator and denominator of the average-life calculation (see Section
G.1.c.), so that the denominator equals the principal balance in effect for the period of the
settlement date (exclusive of accrued interest). For Z-bonds, the numerator and denominator
should include only the positive principal payments (amount “(2)” if positive, 0 otherwise),
and the denominator will generally be larger than the principal balance at settlement.
Example: To illustrate these points, consider the following hypothetical accrual instrument:
Time

Net
Cash Flow

10% Periodic
Interest

(= Cash Flow – Interest)

Principal

If there is no cash-flow delay, then the average life under the GPM/ARM convention is
1( −10) + 2 (0) + 3 (110)
−10 + 0 + 110

=

320
= 3.20 periods.
100

Under the Z-bond convention, the average life is
1(0) + 2 (0) + 3 (110)
0 + 0

+ 10

=

330
= 3.00 periods.
110

The GPM/ARM definition has the advantage of preserving the intended relationship
between average life and interest-rate risk. In particular, the average life of a fixed-income
security should roughly equal the term to maturity for which a bullet with the same coupon
would have the same price-sensitivity per purchase dollar. This is the purpose for which average life is used in the absence of duration measures. In general, negative principal payments
lead to longer average lives, in some cases longer than the final maturity.
It should be noted that the Z-bond definition of average life can substantially understate the
true interest-rate sensitivity of a security, and that the combined average life of the bond
classes of a CMO containing Z-bonds can be inconsistent with the average life of the underlying collateral. Analysts and traders should be aware of these facts when average-life comparisons are being made.
2. Accrual Calculations for CMO Z-Bonds
The special calculation method for the settlement of accrual bonds has been discontinued for
trades made on or after July 15, 1991, with settlement on or after October 1, 1991.
Henceforth, these trades will follow the standards set forth in Sections F.1. and F.2.
