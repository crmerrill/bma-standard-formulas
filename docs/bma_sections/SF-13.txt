Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

If desired, one can then convert these SMM rates into CPR or PSA according to the usual
formulas. (See Section B.2.)
For purposes of describing an empirical prepayment pattern over a selected historical period,
the appropriate ABS speed is the one whose monthly prepayment rates give the correct
cumulative paydown for the period. The following formula provides the correct historical
ABS speed for any time interval in which the loan age, pool factor and amortized loan balance (as a fraction of par) changed from AGE1, F1, BAL1 to AGE2, F2, BAL2:
ABS = 100

(F F ) − ( BAL BAL )
AGE ( F F ) − AGE ( BAL BAL ).

The size of the pool at origination is not required. BAL may be calculated as in Section B.1.
Example: For a pool of 36-month car loans issued 1/1/89 with an original WAM of 34
months, a prepayment speed of 2% ABS for 9/89 would correspond to
SMM =

100 * 2
= 2.5000%.
100 – 2 * (11 –1)

If the gross WAC of the pool is 10.00% and the 10/1/89 factor is 0.64140448, then the average prepayment speed over the nine-month life of the pool is
