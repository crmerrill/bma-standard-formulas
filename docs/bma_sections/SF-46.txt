Fest = F0 * 1 + (COUPON/100) * ( N 0/360) ,

where F0 is the most recently published factor, COUPON is the annual coupon rate of the
security in percent and N0 is the number of days from the “as-of” date for F0 to the “asof” date for the current settlement factor F, measured according to the 30/360 calendar.
3. Freddie Mac Multiclass PCs (REMICs)
Unlike most other mortgage-related securities, Freddie Mac REMICs have record dates that
are in the middle of the month, while the tranche factors are updated at the beginning of the
month. This practice requires special considerations for the computation of settlement balances and accrued interest. (Parties to transactions may agree on terms other than those set
out here.)
a.

Fixed-Rate REMIC Classes
Principal and accrued interest are determined using the factor as of the last Record Date
prior to the Settlement Date. Accrued interest will be paid to the seller for the time from
the day following that Record Date to the Settlement Date.
Example:
Factor Dates - 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, etc.
Record Dates - 1/14, 2/14, 3/14, etc.
Settlement Date - 2/15 to 3/14
Accrued Interest calculation - days from 2/15 to Settlement Date (no accrued interest if
Settlement Date is 2/15)
A holder of record on 3/14 (the buyer) receives principal and interest from Freddie Mac
on 4/15. The dollar amounts are determined by the following formulas, where F(m/d)
denotes the factor as of a date, FACE denotes the original face amount and COUPON
denotes the annual coupon rate in percent:

[

]

Principal = F(2 1) − F( 3 1) * FACE,
Interest = F(2 1) * FACE * COUPON/1200.

b.

Variable-Rate REMIC Classes
Principal is determined using the factor as of the last Record Date prior to the
Settlement Date. Accrued interest is determined using the factor as of the second Record
Date prior to the Settlement Date, however, because the accrual period follows the
Record Date for variable-rate classes whereas it precedes the Record Date for fixed-rate
classes. Therefore, at settlement, one should deduct from the cost the accrued interest for
the time from the Settlement Date to the day following the first Record Date on or after
the Settlement Date, at the coupon rate in effect as of the Settlement Date.
