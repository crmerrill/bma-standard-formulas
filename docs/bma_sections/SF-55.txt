ued as if received on the put date, regardless of scheduled loan payment dates or payment delay.
Example: Suppose an FHA project loan pass-through has the following characteristics:
Gross Coupon

=

7.50%

Net Coupon

=

7.43%

Actual Delay

=

24 days

Original Term

=

40 years

Origination Date

=

2/1/79

Put Date

=

6/1/99

Put calculations should then be based on the investor’s receiving the 6/99 principal balance (valued at 96%, paid on the put date) plus 100% of the final pass-through cash
flow (the principal and interest for 5/99, paid on 6/25/99 according to the scheduled
delay). These represent standard valuation assumptions, not actual cash flows. If the
security trades at 85 for settlement on 2/1/89, then
Yield to Put

=

9.77078%,

Average Life to Put

=

9.72452 years.

H. Accrual Instruments
1. Average Life of Accrual Instruments
For CMO Z-bonds, Graduated-Payment Mortgages (GPMs) or Adjustable-Rate Mortgages
(ARMs) with capped payments, principal balances can increase over the life of the bonds.
Interest accrued (but not paid out) for a payment period is treated as a negative principal
payment, occurring on the payment date for that period. This is consistent with the accepted
definition of the net cash flow on a payment date as the sum of
(1) simple interest due on the principal balance for the full payment period
and
(2) a return of principal (positive or negative).
No portion of the cash flow is treated as interest-on-interest. Instead, there is a formal conversion of accrued interest to loan principal on payment dates (negative amortization).
It follows that at the end of every payment period, one should first compute the value of
“(1)” and then subtract it from the net cash flow on the payment date to obtain the correct
value of “(2).” The outstanding principal balance changes by amount “(2),” and only on payment dates, not daily.
