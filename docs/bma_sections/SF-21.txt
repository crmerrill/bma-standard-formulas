Year of Mortgage Life
* Last 12 months are at a 0% default rate assuming 12 months to liquidation for 30-year loans. (See Section C.3.j.)

5. Use of the SDA for Products Other Than 30-Year Conventional Mortgages
The SDA was designed for use with fully amortizing residential mortgages with a term of at
least 15 years. It was not intended to be used with other securitized products, e.g., balloon
mortgages, commercial mortgages, home equity loans or any nonmortgage assets such as
auto loans and credit card receivables.
6. Numerical Examples of SDA
Sample Cash Flows
The following two sample cash-flow tables were computed using new 30-year loans with an
8% WAC, 12-month recovery period, 20 percent loss severity and servicer advances. Further,
Cash Flow A illustrates 1% Monthly Prepayments (1% SMM) with a 1% Monthly Default
Rate (1% MDR), and Cash Flow B illustrates 150% PSA Prepayments with 100% SDA.
