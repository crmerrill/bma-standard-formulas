Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

The Loss Severity is applied to the balance of the loan as of the month it first went into
default. The loss rate should include all costs: foreclosure costs, servicer interest
advances and principal advances.
If P&I are being advanced, the maximum principal amount that can be passed through
to investors when the loan is finally liquidated is the balance of the loan when it became
delinquent minus any principal that has been advanced.
If P&I are not being advanced, then 0% loss severity (i.e., 100% recovery) will not
include recovery of unpaid interest unless explicitly specified to the contrary.
Note: With this definition and “Time to Liquidation” as defined above, 0 months to
liquidation with 0% Loss Severity will produce the same total principal cash flow as
Voluntary Prepayment, except that Scheduled Amortization is not broken out separately.
(Also, if P&I are not being advanced, the default cash flow will not include the final
month’s interest.)

h.

Because defaults are being specified as a percentage of the then outstanding Performing
Balance, a higher prepayment assumption at a given default rate will result in lower
cumulative defaults. Therefore, a table must be produced that shows cumulative defaults
in a matrix format using the different default and prepayment rates employed in the
analysis.

i.

A similar matrix of loss amounts should also be produced using the Loss Severity
assumption.

3. Standard Formulas for Computing Mortgage Cash Flows with Defaults
The following formulas detail the calculations:
PERF BAL(i)

= Performing Balance in month i
= PERF BAL(i–1) – NEW DEF(i) – VOL PREPAY(i) – ACT AM (i)

NEW DEF(i)

= New Defaults
= PERF BAL(i–1) * MDR(i)

FCL(i)

= Loans in Foreclosure
= (NEW DEF(i) + FCL(i–1) – ADB(i)) – AM DEF(i)

SCH AM(i)

= Amortization Schedule assuming no prepayments

EXP AM(i)

= Expected Amortization
= (PERF BAL(i–1) + FCL(i–1) – ADB(i)) * [1–SCH AM(i)/SCH AM(i–1)]

VOL PREPAY(i)

= Voluntary Prepayments
= PERF BAL(i–1) * [SCH AM(i)/SCH AM(i–1)] * SMM(i)
