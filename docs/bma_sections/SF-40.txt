Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

In some cases, a pool’s WAM plus its WALA may add up to more than 360 months for a 30year pool, or 180 months in the case of a 15-year pool. In those cases, a pool’s age should be
defined as 360 – WAM for a 30-year pool, or 180 – WAM for a 15-year pool.
In some cases, the reported WALA may be less than the age of the pool itself. For Ginnie
Maes, the age should be set to MAX (updated WALA, pool age), where pool age is defined as
the time between pool-issue date and as-of date. For Freddie Mac, the loans in a pool may
have an age that is less than the pool age. For any month that the loan age is being calculated
for a month prior to the as-of date of the reported WALA, the minimum loan age is zero.
For Fannie Mae MBS calculations prior to December 7, 2000, or when a WALA for any
agency security is not reported, the age of the mortgages should be estimated as the average
original maturity of the loans (assumed to be 180 or 360 months for 15- and 30-year pools;
120 or 240 months for 10- and 20-year pools), minus the original WAM of the loans (at the
time of the pool formation), plus the time elapsed since pool formation. This method is
referred to as a Calculated Loan Age, or “CAGE.”
In the case of "same-month" loan concentrations greater than 50%, the original WAM may
be reported as one month greater than the original loan term for a given pool type. For
example, an original WAM of 361 would be reported for a "CL" pool that has an original
loan term of 360 months. The CAGE should be set to 0 for the first month of these pools,
instead of –1, which would be the result of the calculation. The second month of these pools
would also have a CAGE of 0, while the third month would have a CAGE of 1.
Example of CAGE calculation:
Original Maturity:

360 months

Original WAM:

348 months

Issue Date:

7/1/91

Current Date:

7/1/92

CAGE is calculated as (360 – 348) + 12 = 24.
In some cases, this calculation will result in an age estimate that is too long. If the age
as calculated above is greater than the original maturity minus the current WAM,
then CAGE should be defined as the original maturity minus the current WAM.
Example:

Original Maturity:

360 months

Original WAM:

300 months

Current WAM:

348 months

Issue Date:

7/1/91

Current Date:

7/1/92

The age estimate (360 – 300) + 12 = 72 is greater than 360 – 348 = 12, so the average
loan age should be set to 12.
