Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

For expositional purposes, AGE is defined as a point in time, whereas MONTH is
defined as a span of time. Pool factors therefore are reported as of an AGE whereas
prepayment rates are reported for a MONTH. When a mortgage loan is originated,
AGE= 0. After MONTH=1, AGE = 1. The diagram below illustrates the distinction.

Mortgages in their first 30 months are commonly referred to as “new”; mortgages older
than 30 months are considered “seasoned.”
If the prepayment rate resulting from any of these calculations is either negative or
unusually large, then there may be an error in one or both of the pool factors, or possibly in the coupon rate or term to maturity assumed for amortizing the mortgage balance. Such results must be taken with caution.
Example: Suppose that for a Ginnie Mae I 9.0% pass-through issued 3/1/88 with a
remaining term of 359 months, the 6/1/89 and 7/1/89 pool factors were
F1 = 0.85150625

and
F2 = 0.84732282 ,

respectively. How would one compute the prepayment speed for 6/89 using PSA?
The amortized loan balance was
BAL1 =

1 − (1 + 9.5 1200)
1 − (1 + 9.5 1200)

−344
−359

= 0.99213300

on 6/1/89, and was
BAL 2 =

1 − (1 + 9.5 1200)
1 − (1 + 9.5 1200)

−343
−359

= 0.99157471

on 7/1/89, so with no June prepayments the 7/1/89 pool factor would have been
Fsched = F1

BAL 2
= 0.85102709.
