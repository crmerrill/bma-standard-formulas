Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

The DM represents the increment over the index rate that causes the settlement price of
a floating-rate security to equal the discounted present value of its cash flows, with
yield-compounding frequency matching the security payment schedule. As in the YTM
Spread calculation, the DM uses assumed future values for the index rate (which must
be specified if not equal to the current level). The DM is more general than the YTM
Spread, however, in that the DM allows for varying interest-rate scenarios and the YTM
Spread does not. At the same time, the DM is less general than the YTM Spread in that
DMs cannot be compared for securities with different payment frequencies, while YTM
Spreads can. The full equation defining DM is

P =

+ ... ,

where P is the dollar price of the security (including the correct accrued interest), CFK is
the cash flow received by the investor at time TK (measured in years, and where T0 is
settlement day), IK is the assumed index rate from time TK -1 to time TK (with gross-up
calendar conversion as described in (2) above, as appropriate, but without semiannual
compounding conversion), and the sum is over all future cash flows K = 1,2,... .
Ordinarily, the TK will be computed on the same calendar basis as the cash flows.
However, it is sometimes necessary to compare two securities whose payment frequencies are the same but whose cash flows are determined by different calendar bases. The
TK must be computed on the same calendar basis for both. Quotations should always
specify which calendar basis is being used.
Example: Each March 1 and September 1, a hypothetical FRCMO pays the interest
accrued during the six-month period ending one month prior to the payment date, computed on an ACTUAL/ACTUAL calendar basis, using a rate that resets monthly to 50 basis
points above the three-month LIBOR level on the second business day prior to the first of
that month. Assume that the security trades at 99 for settlement on 3/17/89, with threemonth LIBOR at 10-3/16%. Assume further that LIBOR was 9-3/8% on 1/30/89 and 1015/16% on 2/27/89, and that half the principal is repaid on 9/1/89 and half on 3/1/90.
All calculations will use the same cash flows:
