Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

A. Computational Accuracy
Many common calculations for mortgage-related securities (yields, durations, prepayment rates,
etc.) require the calculation of a large number of intermediate quantities (cash flows, principal
balances, etc.). All intermediate calculations should be carried out to their full precision, preserving at least ten significant digits of accuracy. This will generally require double-precision computer arithmetic. The only quantities that should be assigned an integer variable type are those
that represent whole numbers of days, months or years.
Only when all computations are complete should the final values be rounded for display. Results
may be shown to any desired number of decimal places, provided that the last digit presented has
been obtained by rounding and not by truncating the complete figure.
The numerical examples that appear throughout the document are intended to provide simple
checks against improper implementation of the Standard Formulas, not an exhaustive set of
benchmarks that would guarantee conformance.

B. Prepayments
1. Cash Flows
For a level-payment fixed-rate mortgage pool with gross weighted-average coupon C%, current weighted-average remaining term M months, and M0-M months elapsed since origination, the amortized loan balance (as a fraction of par) is
BAL =

1 – (1 + C 1200)
1 – (1 + C 1200)

−M

−M 0

and the scheduled gross monthly payment (also as a fraction of par) is
GROSS MORTGAGE PAYMENT = PRINCIPAL + INTEREST
= ( BAL1 − BAL 2 ) + ( BAL1 * C 1200)
=

C 1200
1 – (1 + C 1200) −M 0 .

The net payment passed through to investors consists of the scheduled gross payment above,
plus unscheduled prepayments, minus a servicing fee of BAL1 * S/1200, where the servicing
percentage (S) is the difference between the gross coupon (C) and the net pass-through
coupon of the security.
The pool factor (F) expresses the principal remaining in the pool each month as a fraction of
the original face amount. The survival factor (F/BAL) represents the fraction of $1.00 unit
loans remaining in the pool from those originally present at issuance:

POOL FACTOR = SURVIVAL FACTOR * AMORTIZED LOAN BALANCE.
By convention, mortgage-related security analysis assumes that all prepayments are whole
prepayments on $1.00 unit loans within the pool.
The cash flows of more complex mortgage securities (CMO bonds, Graduated-Payment
Mortgages, Adjustable-Rate Mortgages, etc.) are governed by specific contractual features
not addressed here.
Example: A mortgage pass-through is issued with a net coupon of 9.0%, a gross coupon of
9.5% and a term of 360 months. If prepayments for the first month are 0.00025022 (as a
fraction of par), then the first cash flow paid to investors will consist of the following
components:
(1) Scheduled Amortization

=

0.00049188,

(2) Unscheduled Prepayments =

0.00025022,

(3) Gross Mortgage Interest

=

0.00791667,

(4) Servicing Fee

=

0.00041667,

2. Mortgage Prepayment Models
The prepayment rate of a mortgage pool may be expressed in a number of different ways.
These measures are equally valid, although a particular method may be more useful in a
given instance.
a.

The SMM (Single Monthly Mortality) rate of a mortgage pool is the percentage of the
mortgage loans outstanding at the beginning of a month assumed to terminate during
the month. That is, if in some month the initial and final pool factors are F1 and F2,
respectively (as fractions of the original face amount), and the amortized loan balances
are BAL1 and BAL2 (as fractions of par), then
 BAL 2   SMM 
F2 = F1 * 

 * 1 −
100  .
 BAL1  

An equivalent means of specifying a one-month prepayment rate is to separate the factor drop for the month (F1–F2) into scheduled and unscheduled principal payments. If
there were no unscheduled prepayments during the month, then the factor for the end
of the month would have been

Fsched = F1

BAL 2
BAL1 .

The quantity F1–Fsched represents amortization for the month, and Fsched–F2 represents
early prepayment of principal. The one-month prepayment rate can then be defined as

SMM = 100

Fsched − F2
Fsched .

Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

The CPR (Conditional Prepayment Rate or Constant Prepayment Rate) model is similar
to SMM, except that it expresses the prepayment percentage as an annually compounded rate:
12

CPR
 SMM 
1 –
 =1−

100 
100 .

The terms “CPR” and “Monthly CPR” have sometimes been used to express prepayment
rates on a monthly basis equivalent to the SMM. This is not recommended, and in the
present document, “CPR” will refer exclusively to the annualized prepayment rate
defined in the equation above.
c.

The Standard Prepayment Model of The Bond Market Association specifies a prepayment
percentage for each month in the life of the underlying mortgages, expressed on an
annualized basis. Thus, 100% PSA (Prepayment Speed Assumptions) assumes prepayment rates of 0.2% CPR in the first month following origination of the mortgage loans
(not the pool) and an additional 0.2% CPR in each succeeding month until the 30th
month. In the 30th month and beyond, 100% PSA assumes a fixed annual prepayment
rate of 6.0% CPR. To calculate the prepayment rate for any specific multiple of PSA,
adjust the annual prepayment rate at 100% PSA by that multiple. (For example, 200%
PSA assumes prepayment rates equal to twice the CPRs from the 100% PSA model, on a
pool-by-pool basis.) In general,
 PSA

CPR = min 
* 0.2 * max 1,min {MONTH, 30} , 100  ,
 100


{

}

where MONTH refers to the accrual period during which the age of the mortgage loans
increases from MONTH – 1 to MONTH. If the loan age is computed as zero subsequent
to pool-issue date, then for the purposes of the PSA calculations, MONTH equals 1 for
all prior months. In the case of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pools with “same-month”
loan concentrations greater than 50%, MONTH would equal 1 for the first two months
of the pool. For Freddie Macs, these pools are identified by the WALA remaining at 0 for
the first two months of the pool. For Fannie Maes, these pools are identified by the original WAM being one month greater than the original loan term for a given pool type.
For example, an original WAM of 361 would be reported for a “CL” pool that has an
original loan term of 360 months.
These CPRs can then be converted into SMMs according to the formula from part (b.)
above.

For expositional purposes, AGE is defined as a point in time, whereas MONTH is
defined as a span of time. Pool factors therefore are reported as of an AGE whereas
prepayment rates are reported for a MONTH. When a mortgage loan is originated,
AGE= 0. After MONTH=1, AGE = 1. The diagram below illustrates the distinction.

Mortgages in their first 30 months are commonly referred to as “new”; mortgages older
than 30 months are considered “seasoned.”
If the prepayment rate resulting from any of these calculations is either negative or
unusually large, then there may be an error in one or both of the pool factors, or possibly in the coupon rate or term to maturity assumed for amortizing the mortgage balance. Such results must be taken with caution.
Example: Suppose that for a Ginnie Mae I 9.0% pass-through issued 3/1/88 with a
remaining term of 359 months, the 6/1/89 and 7/1/89 pool factors were
F1 = 0.85150625

and
F2 = 0.84732282 ,

respectively. How would one compute the prepayment speed for 6/89 using PSA?
The amortized loan balance was
BAL1 =

1 − (1 + 9.5 1200)
1 − (1 + 9.5 1200)

−344
−359

= 0.99213300

on 6/1/89, and was
BAL 2 =

1 − (1 + 9.5 1200)
1 − (1 + 9.5 1200)

−343
−359

= 0.99157471

on 7/1/89, so with no June prepayments the 7/1/89 pool factor would have been
Fsched = F1

BAL 2
= 0.85102709.

With respect to the underlying 360-month mortgages, 2/88 was month 1, so 6/89 counts
as month 17. Therefore,

Find the column corresponding to the ONE-MONTH PSA, and the row corresponding to the number of months after origination of the underlying mortgages.
The intersection of column and row gives the one-month equivalent SMM.
Do not use this table for 3-month, 1-year, or to-date PSA, as results will be inaccurate.
Results will be imprecise to the extent that mortgages in a pool have differing ages.

3. Average Prepayment Rates for Mortgage Pools
Often it is necessary to calculate an average prepayment rate for a single mortgage pool or an
aggregation of pools (such as those backing a particular CMO) over a specific historical period.* Regardless of which particular prepayment model is chosen, the proper speed is that
which, if applied separately to the underlying mortgages over the entire period, would result
in the actual aggregate balance recorded at the end of the period. Pools which were not present at the start of the period should be excluded from the calculation entirely, as should any
pools with incorrect or missing factors at the start or end of the period.**
For certain security types, including many CMOs backed by classes of two or more other
CMOs, and many whole loan pass-throughs with principal/interest stripping, the cash flows
and principal balances are not derived from pro rata shares of mortgage pass-throughs, and
no single prepayment rate or aggregate balance is sufficient to characterize the security cash
flows. In these cases, it is generally not meaningful to define an average prepayment rate, and
none should be reported. Instead, the average prepayment rate for each underlying CMO
class should be reported individually, or if not practical, then summarized together as a range
(lowest and highest).
Unless otherwise specified, amortization of updated fixed-rate mortgage pools should be
based exclusively on the most recent weighted average maturity information (WAM or
WARM) and prepayment calculations on the most recent weighted average loan age (WALA)
information provided by the issuer or guarantor at the time the calculation is performed.
(See Section D.) Thus, it is not necessary to save prior information for these pools once
updated values become available, nor is it necessary to recompute previously calculated prepayment rates. This method, while computationally simple, will produce different results for
the same time period when calculations are made at different times. Thus, the January 1991
PSA rate for a pool may be different when calculated in February 1992 than when first computed in February 1991, because the WAM and/or the WALA may not have decreased and/or
increased, respectively, by exactly 12 months. Individual firms may use either method to
report historical prepayment rates. This decision affects only calculations of historical prepayment rates; projected cash flows, yields, average lives, and other measures are not affected,
since forward projections always use the most recently available data.
For certain security types, such as Fannie Mae Trust strips and Megapools, multiple passthrough pools are actually combined into a new pass-through security (an aggregate pool for
which the issuer reports monthly factors). Even in these cases, historical and projected prepayments should be calculated on the basis of the most detailed pool information available
for the underlying mortgages.

* For a mortgage security (including but not limited to CMOs, REMICs, Megapools and strips), the phrase “prepayment rate since
issue” can refer to the time since issuance of either the underlying pass-through pools or the mortgage security itself. Market participants should therefore distinguish between “prepayment rate since pool issue” and “prepayment rate since deal issue.” The precise
wording is left to the user’s discretion, so long as the intent is clear.
** Note that an aggregate calculation for “prepayment rate since pool issue” generally does not refer to a historical period with a uniform
starting date. Therefore, the only pools that should be excluded from this particular calculation are those with incorrect or missing
factors at the end of the period.

With the Standard Prepayment Model, these calculations will generally require an iterative
trial-and-error procedure, even for a single pool; the aggregate PSA speed should not be
computed as a weighted average of individual pool speeds. Likewise, it is generally not accurate to apply an average prepayment speed to a hypothetical single pool having the aggregate
WAC and WAM of the pools to be analyzed. At best, these calculations can provide a first
iteration toward the correct value. Average prepayment rates that do not meet the precise
specifications of the preceding paragraphs should be acknowledged as nonstandard approximations.
Iteration is not necessary for computing average prepayment rates in terms of SMM or CPR.
Instead, one should sum the scheduled balances for the loans at the end of the period, computed as if there were no prepayments during the period. The average prepayment rate for
the aggregation is then

Finally, for the special case in which all the mortgages in the sample being considered are
fully seasoned at the start of the period, even the aggregate PSA speed can be computed
without iteration:
PSA avg = 100 *

To determine the average prepayment rate of the two pools over the first six months of 1989, first
compute the actual final balance,
1,000,000 (0.84732282) + 2,000,000 (0.98290230) = 2,813,127.42 ,

and the scheduled final balance,
1,000,000 (0.86925218)

and, by iterative trial-and-error,
PSA avg = 212.02% .

4. ABS Prepayment Rates for Asset Pools
The ABS model defines an increasing sequence of monthly prepayment rates (SMM, the percentage
of remaining loans that prepay each month), which corresponds to a constant absolute level of loan
prepayments in all future periods. For a pool of new loans, the SMM sequence for X% ABS is equivalent to the prepayment each month of X% of the loans originally in the pool. For a pool of seasoned
loans, however, this interpretation of the SMM sequence is generally not valid. To avoid possible confusion, the ABS speed and the age of the underlying loans (not the pool) should always be converted
directly into a sequence of SMM rates according to the formula
SMM =

100 * ABS
100 – ABS * ( MONTH –1).

If desired, one can then convert these SMM rates into CPR or PSA according to the usual
formulas. (See Section B.2.)
For purposes of describing an empirical prepayment pattern over a selected historical period,
the appropriate ABS speed is the one whose monthly prepayment rates give the correct
cumulative paydown for the period. The following formula provides the correct historical
ABS speed for any time interval in which the loan age, pool factor and amortized loan balance (as a fraction of par) changed from AGE1, F1, BAL1 to AGE2, F2, BAL2:
ABS = 100

(F F ) − ( BAL BAL )
AGE ( F F ) − AGE ( BAL BAL ).

The size of the pool at origination is not required. BAL may be calculated as in Section B.1.
Example: For a pool of 36-month car loans issued 1/1/89 with an original WAM of 34
months, a prepayment speed of 2% ABS for 9/89 would correspond to
SMM =

100 * 2
= 2.5000%.
100 – 2 * (11 –1)

If the gross WAC of the pool is 10.00% and the 10/1/89 factor is 0.64140448, then the average prepayment speed over the nine-month life of the pool is
 1 – (1 + 10 1200)–34 

C. Defaults
The following description of default analysis is intended only for the analysis of credit-sensitive
securities (e.g., subordinated securities such as B-pieces, mezzanines, etc.). Standard prepayment
analysis projects cash flows assuming that unscheduled payoffs are composed of both voluntary
prepayments and defaults. When the following default methodology is being used, voluntary prepayments and defaults are projected separately.
1. Mortgage Cash Flows with Defaults: Description of Basic Concepts
A loan in default is defined as one that no longer pays principal and interest and then
remains delinquent until liquidated. Thus, delinquencies that cure are not included in this
computation.
When a loan first goes into default, it is included in New Defaults for the given month. New
Defaults are projected forward using the Monthly Default Rate and the prior month’s
Performing Balance before subtracting the current month’s scheduled amortization.
The prior month’s Performing Balance is the total balance of all loans that have continued to
make full monthly payments through the prior month. These, plus Loans in Foreclosure, are
the loans that survive into the current month. In the current month, they will either default
(New Defaults), prepay (Voluntary Prepayments), or merely amortize. As with New Defaults,
Voluntary Prepayments are also projected forward using the prior month’s Performing
Balance. However, Voluntary Prepayments are computed after the current month’s Scheduled
Amortization is subtracted.
Expected Amortization in a given month is the amortized principal that is expected to be
received from all existing loans, including those currently in default that have not yet been liquidated (Loans in Foreclosure). If there are New Defaults, then Amortization from Defaults is
the amount of principal that is not received from the borrowers, and Actual Amortization is
the amount of principal that is actually received from the borrowers. (A loan’s original amortization schedule continues to be computed even while it is in foreclosure.)
Analogously, Expected Interest in a given month is interest due on the balance of all existing
loans (including Loans in Foreclosure). Interest Lost is the amount of interest not received,
and Actual Interest is Expected Interest minus Interest Lost.
Usually (but not always), Servicer Advances are made. If principal and interest are advanced,
the amount of principal advanced each month is equal to Amortization from Defaults, and
the amount of interest advanced exactly compensates for Lost Interest. The result is that
investors receive all Expected Amortization and Expected Interest regardless of the amount
of New Defaults and Loans in Foreclosure. New Defaults, however, are still calculated based
on the prior month’s Performing Balance only.
Liquidation of New Defaults is assumed to occur after a fixed user-specified number of
months (Months to Liquidation). If the liquidation results in a loss, the loss is taken in the
month of liquidation, treated as a loss of principal (Principal Loss), and the amount of the
loss is based on the Loss Severity and the unpaid principal balance of New Defaults when the
loan first went into default.

2. Specifying Mortgage Default Assumptions: Standards and Definitions
Introduction
The prepayment calculations discussed in Section B.2. derive monthly prepayment rates
(SMM) from a vector of pool factors (F) over time. In other words, a prepayment rate is
derived from actual performance data.
The Default Standards are intended to be used for projecting cash flows, not for deriving historical default rates from actual performance data. In other words, we start with a Monthly
Default Rate (MDR) and use it to calculate New Defaults (NEW DEF) in a given month.
Default Analysis Standards and Definitions
a.

Default analysis is intended to model defaults only, not delinquencies. Delinquent loans
that are cured will not be part of this analysis. For this purpose, a loan in default is one
that no longer pays principal and interest and then remains delinquent until liquidated.

b.

Default analysis specifies default rates, not loss rates. Loss rates (i.e., “Loss Severities”)
are specified separately.

c.

The default rate in a given month is specified as a percentage of the aggregate performing balance of all loans still outstanding at the end of the prior month, before taking into
account the current month’s scheduled amortization.

d.

Prepayment rates and default rates are specified separately. Total unscheduled principal
received will then be the sum of Voluntary Prepayments and Principal Recoveries from
liquidations.

e.

The prepayment rate in a given month is specified as a percentage of the aggregate performing balance of all loans still outstanding at the end of the prior month, after removing the current month’s scheduled amortization. Prepayments will still be deemed to
have a scheduled component, whereas the default balance is computed before taking into
account the current month’s amortization. Voluntary Prepayments are constrained by
the following condition: Actual Amortization plus New Defaults plus Voluntary
Prepayments cannot exceed the prior period’s Performing Balance. (If they do, then cap
Voluntary Prepayments such that the current period’s Performing Balance is zero.)

f.

When performing default analysis, in addition to specifying default rates, the following
assumptions must be specified:

• Time to Liquidation after the loan first misses a payment (“0 months to
•
•

Liquidation” means that liquidation proceeds are received in the month the loan
first becomes delinquent).
Loss Severity or Loss Severity curve. “Loss Severity” is defined as a loss amount
divided by the principal balance of the loan at the time it goes into default. A
“Loss Severity curve” is a vector of different loss severities over time.
Whether or not P&I are advanced in the structure. If P&I are advanced, they are
assumed to be advanced every month through to liquidation.

g.

Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

The Loss Severity is applied to the balance of the loan as of the month it first went into
default. The loss rate should include all costs: foreclosure costs, servicer interest
advances and principal advances.
If P&I are being advanced, the maximum principal amount that can be passed through
to investors when the loan is finally liquidated is the balance of the loan when it became
delinquent minus any principal that has been advanced.
If P&I are not being advanced, then 0% loss severity (i.e., 100% recovery) will not
include recovery of unpaid interest unless explicitly specified to the contrary.
Note: With this definition and “Time to Liquidation” as defined above, 0 months to
liquidation with 0% Loss Severity will produce the same total principal cash flow as
Voluntary Prepayment, except that Scheduled Amortization is not broken out separately.
(Also, if P&I are not being advanced, the default cash flow will not include the final
month’s interest.)

h.

Because defaults are being specified as a percentage of the then outstanding Performing
Balance, a higher prepayment assumption at a given default rate will result in lower
cumulative defaults. Therefore, a table must be produced that shows cumulative defaults
in a matrix format using the different default and prepayment rates employed in the
analysis.

i.

A similar matrix of loss amounts should also be produced using the Loss Severity
assumption.

3. Standard Formulas for Computing Mortgage Cash Flows with Defaults
The following formulas detail the calculations:
PERF BAL(i)

= Performing Balance in month i
= PERF BAL(i–1) – NEW DEF(i) – VOL PREPAY(i) – ACT AM (i)

NEW DEF(i)

= New Defaults
= PERF BAL(i–1) * MDR(i)

FCL(i)

= Loans in Foreclosure
= (NEW DEF(i) + FCL(i–1) – ADB(i)) – AM DEF(i)

SCH AM(i)

= Amortization Schedule assuming no prepayments

EXP AM(i)

= Expected Amortization
= (PERF BAL(i–1) + FCL(i–1) – ADB(i)) * [1–SCH AM(i)/SCH AM(i–1)]

VOL PREPAY(i)

= Voluntary Prepayments
= PERF BAL(i–1) * [SCH AM(i)/SCH AM(i–1)] * SMM(i)

Notes for clarification:
a.

“New Defaults” are the product of the default rate and prior period’s Performing
Balance.

b.

“Voluntary Prepayments” are the product of the prepayment rate and the prior period’s
Performing Balance, minus expected amortization from performing balance.

c.

Voluntary Prepayments and New Defaults are constrained by the following condition:
Actual Amortization + New Defaults + Voluntary Prepayments cannot exceed the prior
period’s Performing Balance. (See Section C. 2.e.)

d.

“Expected Amortization” is computed from the sum of the prior period’s Performing
Balance and Loans in Foreclosure.

e.

Loans in Foreclosure do not include any loans that are liquidated in the current month.

f.

Expected Amortization and Amortization from Defaults are not computed for loans in
their liquidation month. (This is a consequence of (d) and (e).)

g.

“Actual Amortization” is computed based on the prior period’s Performing Balance
minus New Defaults.

h.

Principal Recovery is constrained by the following condition:
If Amortization from Defaults is advanced, the maximum Principal Recovery amount is
the loan balance when the loan went into foreclosure minus the cumulative amortization advanced until the loan was liquidated (i.e., the Amortized Default Balance in the
liquidation month). (See Section C. 2.g.)

i.

Principal Loss is constrained by the following condition:
If Amortization from Defaults is advanced, the maximum Principal Loss is the
Amortized Default Balance in the liquidation month.

j.

Default rate is set to 0 for the last n months before the scheduled final maturity of the
pool where n = Time to Liquidation.

4. The Standard Default Assumption (SDA)
A Standard Default Assumption (“100% SDA”) for performing default analysis will have the
following characteristics:
a.

Rise from 0 to “peak” during the first 30 months of mortgage age;

b.

Remain constant at peak value for the next 30 months (i.e., months 30 to 60 are at peak
value);

c.

Decline from “peak” to “tail” over the next 60 months (i.e., decline begins in month 61
and reaches tail value in month 120);

d.

Remain constant at “tail” value for the remaining life of the pool (except for the last
n months, when the default rate will be 0. n = Time to Liquidation); and

e.

Reach a default peak of 0.60% per annum and decline to a default tail of 0.03% per
annum.

f.

To adjust the Standard Default Assumption rate for any specific multiple of SDA, adjust
the annual default rate at 100% SDA by that multiple. (For example, 200% SDA
assumes a default rate equal to twice the annual rates specified by 100% SDA.)

g.

When implementing default percentages, the annual default rates must be converted to
Monthly Default Rates according to the following formula:
MDR = Monthly Default Rate = 100 * (1 – (1 – (Annual Default Rate /100))1/12
(in percent)

The following table illustrates the default matrix that must be produced as discussed in
Section C.2.h. For example, 100% SDA would result in approximately 2.78% cumulative defaults over the life of a pool of new 8%, 30-year mortgages that also prepay at
150% PSA.

5. Use of the SDA for Products Other Than 30-Year Conventional Mortgages
The SDA was designed for use with fully amortizing residential mortgages with a term of at
least 15 years. It was not intended to be used with other securitized products, e.g., balloon
mortgages, commercial mortgages, home equity loans or any nonmortgage assets such as
auto loans and credit card receivables.
6. Numerical Examples of SDA

The following two sample cash-flow tables were computed using new 30-year loans with an
8% WAC, 12-month recovery period, 20 percent loss severity and servicer advances. Further,
Cash Flow A illustrates 1% Monthly Prepayments (1% SMM) with a 1% Monthly Default
Rate (1% MDR), and Cash Flow B illustrates 150% PSA Prepayments with 100% SDA.

D. Assumptions for Generic Pools
l.

Mortgage Maturity
As noted in Section B.3., amortization of fixed-rate mortgage pools should be based on the
most recent weighted-average maturity information (WAM or WARM) provided by the
issuer or guarantor at the time the calculation is performed. The published WAM for a pool
is the WAM as of a particular date. If the calculation is being performed as of a month other
than the month to which the WAM applies, the WAM should be incremented or decremented by the number of months prior or subsequent to the WAM as-of month, respectively.
If the issuer or guarantor of a particular pass-through security has not released an updated
WAM, the most recently released WAM may be used as described in the preceding paragraph, adjusted as described therein for the time elapsed since the as-of date of the WAM.
If the issuer or guarantor of a particular pass-through security has released neither updated
nor original WAM information, then the remaining term to maturity should be used as a
proxy.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide updated WAM information on a monthly basis. Fannie
Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s monthly WAM updates are as of the current month. Freddie Mac’s
monthly WAM updates appear on its “quartile” tapes.
Ginnie Mae provides updated WAM information on a quarterly basis. The as-of date for the
reported WAM depends on when the pool was issued. For pools issued before the third
month prior to the start of the current quarter, the WAM is as of four months prior to the
month of the quarterly release, as described in the table below:
Month of Data Release
January
April
July
October

For Pools Issued Prior To
Previous October
Previous January
Previous April
Previous July

WAM Information Is As Of
September
December
March
June

For pools issued during or subsequent to the third month prior to the start of the current
quarter, the WAM is as of the pool’s issue date.
To adjust the most recently updated WAM on a Ginnie Mae pool to the current month, the
WAM should be decremented by the number of months subsequent to the as-of month for
the WAM, as described below:
Current WAM

=

most recent WAM update – (number of months between the as-of
month of the WAM and the current date)

For example, to adjust the WAM for the October 1993 tape for pools issued prior to July
1993 to be consistent with the October 1993 factor, subtract four months from the WAM.
For pools issued in July, August and September 1993, subtract three months, two months and
one month, respectively.

In some cases, the WAM that is released exceeds the time to final maturity of the pool. In
these cases, the WAM should be set to MIN (updated WAM, time to maturity), where time to
maturity is defined as the time between the as-of date and the pool maturity date.
For Fannie Mae pools with “same-month” loan concentrations greater than 50%, the original
WAM may be reported as one month greater than the original loan term for a given pool
type. For consistency with other mortgage calculations, the first month of amortization
should be based on the reported WAM.
2. Mortgage Age
As noted in Section B.3., prepayment calculations should be based on the most recently
updated weighted-average loan age information (WALA) provided by the issuer or guarantor
at the time the calculation is performed. The published WALA for a pool is the WALA as of a
particular date. If the calculation is being performed as of a month other than the month to
which the WALA applies, the WALA should be incremented or decremented by the number
of months subsequent or prior to the WALA as-of month, respectively.
Ginnie Mae releases updated WALA information on a quarterly basis, and as is the case with
Ginnie Mae WAM updates, this information is reported with a lag. For pools issued before
the third month prior to the month of the most recent WALA update, the WALA is as of four
months prior to the month of the quarterly release, as shown in the table below:
Month of Data Release
January
April
July
October

For Pools Issued Prior To
Previous October
Previous January
Previous April
Previous July

WAM Information Is As Of
September
December
March
June

For pools issued during or subsequent to the third month prior to the start of the current
quarter, the WALA is as of the pool’s issue date.
To adjust the most recently updated WALA on a Ginnie Mae pool to the current month, the
WALA should be incremented by the number of months subsequent to the as-of month for
the WALA, as described below:
Current WALA

=

most recent WALA update + (number of months between the as-of
month of the WALA and the current date)

For example, to adjust the WALA for the October 1993 tape for pools issued prior to July
1993 to be consistent with the October 1993 factor, add four months to the WALA. For pools
issued in July, August and September 1993, add three months, two months and one month,
respectively.

Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

In some cases, a pool’s WAM plus its WALA may add up to more than 360 months for a 30year pool, or 180 months in the case of a 15-year pool. In those cases, a pool’s age should be
defined as 360 – WAM for a 30-year pool, or 180 – WAM for a 15-year pool.
In some cases, the reported WALA may be less than the age of the pool itself. For Ginnie
Maes, the age should be set to MAX (updated WALA, pool age), where pool age is defined as
the time between pool-issue date and as-of date. For Freddie Mac, the loans in a pool may
have an age that is less than the pool age. For any month that the loan age is being calculated
for a month prior to the as-of date of the reported WALA, the minimum loan age is zero.
For Fannie Mae MBS calculations prior to December 7, 2000, or when a WALA for any
agency security is not reported, the age of the mortgages should be estimated as the average
original maturity of the loans (assumed to be 180 or 360 months for 15- and 30-year pools;
120 or 240 months for 10- and 20-year pools), minus the original WAM of the loans (at the
time of the pool formation), plus the time elapsed since pool formation. This method is
referred to as a Calculated Loan Age, or “CAGE.”
In the case of "same-month" loan concentrations greater than 50%, the original WAM may
be reported as one month greater than the original loan term for a given pool type. For
example, an original WAM of 361 would be reported for a "CL" pool that has an original
loan term of 360 months. The CAGE should be set to 0 for the first month of these pools,
instead of –1, which would be the result of the calculation. The second month of these pools
would also have a CAGE of 0, while the third month would have a CAGE of 1.
Example of CAGE calculation:
Original Maturity:

360 months

Original WAM:

348 months

Issue Date:

7/1/91

Current Date:

7/1/92

CAGE is calculated as (360 – 348) + 12 = 24.
In some cases, this calculation will result in an age estimate that is too long. If the age
as calculated above is greater than the original maturity minus the current WAM,
then CAGE should be defined as the original maturity minus the current WAM.
Example:

Original Maturity:

360 months

Original WAM:

300 months

Current WAM:

348 months

Issue Date:

7/1/91

Current Date:

7/1/92

The age estimate (360 – 300) + 12 = 72 is greater than 360 – 348 = 12, so the average
loan age should be set to 12.

If there is a dispersion of loan terms within a given pool, the CAGE calculation will give a
loan age estimate that is too long.
If the original WAM of the loans is not available, the average loan age should be estimated as
the average original maturity of the loans minus the remaining WAM; if the remaining WAM
is not available, the average loan age should be estimated as the average original maturity of
the loans minus time to final maturity.
As noted in Section B, the Standard Prepayment Model of The Bond Market Association and
the ABS model both specify prepayment percentages based on the age of the underlying
loans, not the age of the pool itself. The age of the pool should only be used if there is insufficient information to estimate loan age by any of the above-mentioned methods, subject to
the exception noted below. All WAMs and ages should be rounded to the nearest full month
for use in calculations.
The examples that follow illustrate the determination of WAM and age for selected Freddie
Mac GOLD, Freddie Mac 75-day, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae pools.

* Prior to March 1993, the WAMs reported on Freddie Mac’s quartile tape were for the prior month, although the factor reported on
the GOLD factor tape reflected scheduled principal advanced through the current settlement month. This made it necessary to
decrement the GOLD quartile tape WAM by one month to calculate the prepayment rate. As of March 1993, this calculation will
have already been incorporated in the Freddie Mac quartile tape, so no adjustment is necessary.

3. Mortgage Coupon
If the issuing agency has not released the gross weighted-average coupon (WAC) of the
mortgages underlying a fixed-rate, single-family pool, or if no particular WAC assumption is
specified, then a fixed servicing spread above the pass-through rate must be assumed. For
recently issued pools, the spread should be as follows:

+ 50 bp

Ginnie Mae II

+ 75 bp

Fannie Mae

+ 65 bp

Freddie Mac

E. Day Counts
1. Calendar Basis
The number of days from M1/D1/Y1 to M2/D2/Y2 on a 30/360 calendar basis is computed
according to the following algebraic procedure:
If M1 is 2 and D1 is 28 in a nonleap year (or 29 in a leap year), then change D1 to 30.
If D1 is 31, change D1 to 30.
If at this point D1 is 30 and D2 is 31, change D2 to 30.
Then, the number of days is
N = max {360 * (Y2 − Y1 ) + 30 *(M 2 − M1 ) + (D2 − D1 ),0}

The computation draws no distinctions among business days, holidays and weekends.
These conventions shall apply for both accrued interest and yield calculations on all fixedrate, mortgage-backed securities, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Floating-rate and short-term instruments may be quoted on either a Money Market or a
Bond-Equivalent Yield basis, following Section G.2. Money Market accounting makes use of
the actual number of days from M1/D1/Y1 to M2/D2/Y2, including the former but not the
latter, with the day count then divided by 360.
2. Delay Days

Delay refers to the length of time from the end of an interest-accrual period to the actual
payment of the interest due. The “stated delay” of a mortgage-backed, pass-through security
also includes the time during which interest accrues, and sometimes the accrual date itself.
Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac include the accrual date in their documentation of securities;
Fannie Mae does not.
The yield, duration and average life of a pass-through should be calculated and expressed in
terms of its actual cash-flow delay, defined as the difference between (1) the date a payment
is assumed to be made to investors and (2) the date the payment is assumed to be received
from homeowners, assuming 30-day months.
Market practice for CMOs and derivatives has been to use actual delay. The adoption of
actual delay as the standard for pass-throughs, and the continuation of the use of actual
delay for CMOs and derivatives, will bring greater uniformity to the mortgage market.
Delay days will be assumed to be “actual” unless labeled as “stated,” and stated delay should
always be accompanied by a disclosure of the actual delay. Stated delay may also be called,
simply, “days to first payment.”

No conclusions can be drawn concerning the delay of a principal-only CMO bond, and
hence the ownership period corresponding to a particular payment, absent explicit disclosure
by the issuer. This information is generally available from the issuer for new issues.

F. Settlement-Based Calculations
1. General Rules
For all mortgage pass-throughs and mortgage strips, prospective quotations of yield, duration and average life should be based on the actual settlement date of the transaction or, if
not otherwise specified, The Bond Market Association standard settlement date for the quoted delivery month. However, if the quotations are made later than two business days before
the standard settlement date, for delivery in the same month, then settlement should be
assumed to occur either two business days later or on the last business day of the month,
whichever is sooner. In all cases, calculations involving yields or durations should incorporate the correct amount of accrued interest.
CMOs and Asset-Backed Securities (ABSs) should continue to follow corporate settlement
rules.
Comparisons between current and historical market quotations should be made on a consistent basis (first-of-month vs. first-of-month, for example, or settlement-date vs. settlementdate). The basis of comparison should be disclosed if it would otherwise be a source of
ambiguity or confusion.
a.

Settlement Amount
The amount payable by the buyer to the seller on the settlement date is known as the
settlement amount, net proceeds or total cost, and is the sum of the principal amount
and accrued interest:
COST = [ PRINCIPAL AMOUNT ] + [ ACCRUED INTEREST ] .

* These stated delays would be 44, 49, 54 and 74 days, respectively, under the alternate convention in which the accrual date itself
is not counted.

For most mortgage-related securities, the principal amount and accrued interest are
computed as described in parts b and c below. Special procedures for CMO bonds
whose settlement factors have not been released by the time of settlement, and for
Freddie Mac Multiclass PCs (REMICs), are the subjects of Sections F.2. and F.3. below.
b.

Principal Amount
For most mortgage-related securities, the principal amount (or “current face amount,”
or “current balance”) is equal to the product of the original face amount and the current
factor:
PRINCIPAL AMOUNT = FACE * (PRICE/100) * F,
where

c.

FACE

F

=

=

original face amount of bond
price, as a percentage of current face amount
current factor (factor at start of the payment period containing

Accrued Interest
For most mortgage-related securities, interest accrues according to the following standard calculation:
ACCRUED INTEREST = FACE * F * (COUPON/100) * (N/360),
where

COUPON
N

=
=

annual coupon rate of the security, in percent
number of days from the first day of the accrual period
(the “as-of ” date for the factor F) to the settlement date
itself. (The day count is computed according to the
30/360 calendar, as specified in Section E.1.)

2. CMO Bonds with Unknown Settlement Factors
a.

General Rule
If settlement occurs in a payment period whose factor is not yet available at the time of
settlement, settlement may proceed using the most recently published factor (F0) in
place of the current factor (F) in the settlement formulas of Section F.1., to be corrected
once the current factor is released. This general rule does not apply to accrual bonds in
an accretion period (any payment period immediately following a payment date on
which no cash payments were made).

b.

CMO Accrual Bonds
For CMO accrual bonds that are traded during their accretion period and settled in a
payment period whose current factor is not available at the time of settlement, settlement may proceed using an estimated current factor (Fest) in place of the current factor
(F) in the settlement formulas of Section F.1., to be corrected once the current factor is
released. The estimated current factor is computed as follows:

[

]

Fest = F0 * 1 + (COUPON/100) * ( N 0/360) ,

where F0 is the most recently published factor, COUPON is the annual coupon rate of the
security in percent and N0 is the number of days from the “as-of” date for F0 to the “asof” date for the current settlement factor F, measured according to the 30/360 calendar.
3. Freddie Mac Multiclass PCs (REMICs)
Unlike most other mortgage-related securities, Freddie Mac REMICs have record dates that
are in the middle of the month, while the tranche factors are updated at the beginning of the
month. This practice requires special considerations for the computation of settlement balances and accrued interest. (Parties to transactions may agree on terms other than those set
out here.)
a.

Fixed-Rate REMIC Classes
Principal and accrued interest are determined using the factor as of the last Record Date
prior to the Settlement Date. Accrued interest will be paid to the seller for the time from
the day following that Record Date to the Settlement Date.
Example:
Factor Dates - 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, etc.
Record Dates - 1/14, 2/14, 3/14, etc.
Settlement Date - 2/15 to 3/14
Accrued Interest calculation - days from 2/15 to Settlement Date (no accrued interest if
Settlement Date is 2/15)
A holder of record on 3/14 (the buyer) receives principal and interest from Freddie Mac
on 4/15. The dollar amounts are determined by the following formulas, where F(m/d)
denotes the factor as of a date, FACE denotes the original face amount and COUPON
denotes the annual coupon rate in percent:

[

]

Principal = F(2 1) − F( 3 1) * FACE,
Interest = F(2 1) * FACE * COUPON/1200.

b.

Variable-Rate REMIC Classes
Principal is determined using the factor as of the last Record Date prior to the
Settlement Date. Accrued interest is determined using the factor as of the second Record
Date prior to the Settlement Date, however, because the accrual period follows the
Record Date for variable-rate classes whereas it precedes the Record Date for fixed-rate
classes. Therefore, at settlement, one should deduct from the cost the accrued interest for
the time from the Settlement Date to the day following the first Record Date on or after
the Settlement Date, at the coupon rate in effect as of the Settlement Date.

A holder of record on 2/14 (the seller) receives principal and interest from Freddie Mac
on 3/15. The dollar amounts are determined by the following formulas, where F(m/d)
denotes the factor as of a date, FACE denotes the original face amount, and
COUPON(m/d) denotes the annual coupon rate in percent as of a date:

[

Principal = F (1 1) − F (2 1) * FACE,
Interest = F (1 1) * FACE * COUPON (2 15)/1200.

G. Yield and Yield-Related Measures
1. General Rules
All mortgage-related yields, durations, convexities and holding-period returns should be calculated uniformly on a semiannual-compounding basis, regardless of the frequency of the
actual cash flows used in computing these measures.* The correct computations are specified
in detail below.
a.

Bond-Equivalent Yield (or Semiannual Yield or simply Yield) is the number Y, which satisfies the equation
P =

CF1
CF2
+
+ ... ,
2T1
(1 + Y 200)

Average Life is the dollar-weighted average time to receive future payments of principal

calculated by dividing the Macaulay Duration by the appropriate semiannual compounding factor:

Modified Duration should not be called simply Duration, to avoid confusion between the
two concepts.

Convexity is a measure of the decrease in price-sensitivity of a security per unit increase
in yield. More precisely, convexity equals the price of the security, differentiated twice
with respect to Semiannual Yield, divided by the price. Assuming fixed cash flows (no
prepayment variability), then

When duration and convexity values are computed which do account for interest-sensitive
cash flows in the above equation, reasonable care should be taken to distinguish these measures from their static cash-flow counterparts. (An adjective such as Option-Adjusted,

negative. Effective Duration should never be called Duration or Modified Duration.

All cash flows to which the holder would be entitled, as the owner of record during the

basis after the end of the holding period are discounted back to the end of the holding
period using the assumed reinvestment rate.
The Bond-Equivalent Total Rate of Return is equal to the Bond-Equivalent Yield if the
investment is held to final maturity and the intermediate cash flows are reinvested at a
rate equal to the Bond-Equivalent Yield.
The phrase Total Return may be used to designate either the Rate of Return or the

2. Calculations for Floating-Rate MBS
Definitions follow for two of the most common measures of the value of a floating-rate
security: Yield-to-Maturity Spread (YTM Spread) and Discounted Margin (DM). The consistency of calendar assumptions is particularly important for these calculations.
a.

The YTM Spread is the difference between (1) the yield of a floating-rate security and
(2) the yield of the index rate itself, assuming in both cases that the index rate takes on a
certain fixed value for the indefinite future. (Unless otherwise specified, this should be
the current level of the index rate.)
(1)

Cash flows for the floater are computed strictly according to the specifics of the
security (calendar basis, accrued interest, payment delay, reset frequency, reset
margin, caps, floors, prepayment rates, etc.). The cash-flow yield of the floater is
computed on a 30/360 Bond-Equivalent basis (as specified in Section G.1.) or else
on an ACTUAL/360 Money-Market basis (following the same yield formula but
defining the exponents TK according to ACTUAL/360 calendar accounting).
Ordinarily, the TK will be computed on the same calendar basis as the cash flows.
However, it is sometimes necessary to compare two securities whose cash flows are
determined by different calendar bases. The TK must be computed on the same
calendar basis for both. Quotations should always specify which calendar basis is
being used.

(2)

The cash-flow yield of the benchmark index is simply the index itself, converted if
necessary to a 30/360 Bond-Equivalent basis or an ACTUAL/360 Money-Market
basis, depending on the basis used to compute the cash-flow yield of the floater in
(1) above. To convert ACTUAL/360 yields to 30/360 yields (or vice versa), the
index rate should be multiplied (or divided, as appropriate) by a gross-up factor
of 365/360. No gross-up conversion is necessary between ACTUAL/ACTUAL and
30/360 yields. After converting the index rate to the desired calendar basis (30/360
or ACTUAL/360), index rates expressed on a monthly, quarterly or annual compounding basis should be converted to semiannual compounding.
Calendar conventions for the most common reset indexes are as follows:

Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

The DM represents the increment over the index rate that causes the settlement price of
a floating-rate security to equal the discounted present value of its cash flows, with
yield-compounding frequency matching the security payment schedule. As in the YTM
Spread calculation, the DM uses assumed future values for the index rate (which must
be specified if not equal to the current level). The DM is more general than the YTM
Spread, however, in that the DM allows for varying interest-rate scenarios and the YTM
Spread does not. At the same time, the DM is less general than the YTM Spread in that
DMs cannot be compared for securities with different payment frequencies, while YTM
Spreads can. The full equation defining DM is

where P is the dollar price of the security (including the correct accrued interest), CFK is
the cash flow received by the investor at time TK (measured in years, and where T0 is
settlement day), IK is the assumed index rate from time TK -1 to time TK (with gross-up
calendar conversion as described in (2) above, as appropriate, but without semiannual
compounding conversion), and the sum is over all future cash flows K = 1,2,... .
Ordinarily, the TK will be computed on the same calendar basis as the cash flows.
However, it is sometimes necessary to compare two securities whose payment frequencies are the same but whose cash flows are determined by different calendar bases. The
TK must be computed on the same calendar basis for both. Quotations should always
specify which calendar basis is being used.
Example: Each March 1 and September 1, a hypothetical FRCMO pays the interest
accrued during the six-month period ending one month prior to the payment date, computed on an ACTUAL/ACTUAL calendar basis, using a rate that resets monthly to 50 basis
points above the three-month LIBOR level on the second business day prior to the first of
that month. Assume that the security trades at 99 for settlement on 3/17/89, with threemonth LIBOR at 10-3/16%. Assume further that LIBOR was 9-3/8% on 1/30/89 and 1015/16% on 2/27/89, and that half the principal is repaid on 9/1/89 and half on 3/1/90.
All calculations will use the same cash flows:

3. Putable Project Loans
Certain Federal Housing Administration (FHA) project loans contain provisions allowing the
holders of the loans to put them back to the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) in exchange for a ten-year current-coupon FHA debenture. The current coupon is
defined as an average ten-year Treasury rate. The face amount of the debenture is the remaining balance of the loan on the put date. The put feature can be exercised for one year beginning in the month following 20 years after the final endorsement date on the loan.
The following assumptions apply to yield and average-life calculations for putable project
loans:
a.

Although the debentures carry a ten-year current coupon and are backed by the full
faith and credit of the U.S. Government, it is uncertain what the market value of the
debentures will be immediately after they are issued. The standard assumption has been
that the debentures trade roughly 60 basis points above the ten-year Treasury, equating
to a dollar price of 96. In lieu of a specific yield assumption, the put price of the remaining project loan balance should therefore be assumed to be 96, unless explicitly stated
otherwise.

b.

The final endorsement date of a project loan may be before or after the origination of
the loan. Therefore, a standard put date cannot be assumed (e.g., 20 years after loan
origination). The put date used for calculations should be stated explicitly.

c.

Once a put is declared to FHA, the agency is responsible for paying accrued interest on
the debentures starting from the put date itself. Therefore, the debentures should be val-

ued as if received on the put date, regardless of scheduled loan payment dates or payment delay.

Actual Delay

=

Origination Date

=

Put calculations should then be based on the investor’s receiving the 6/99 principal balance (valued at 96%, paid on the put date) plus 100% of the final pass-through cash
flow (the principal and interest for 5/99, paid on 6/25/99 according to the scheduled
delay). These represent standard valuation assumptions, not actual cash flows. If the
security trades at 85 for settlement on 2/1/89, then

H. Accrual Instruments
1. Average Life of Accrual Instruments
For CMO Z-bonds, Graduated-Payment Mortgages (GPMs) or Adjustable-Rate Mortgages
(ARMs) with capped payments, principal balances can increase over the life of the bonds.
Interest accrued (but not paid out) for a payment period is treated as a negative principal
payment, occurring on the payment date for that period. This is consistent with the accepted
definition of the net cash flow on a payment date as the sum of
(1) simple interest due on the principal balance for the full payment period
and
(2) a return of principal (positive or negative).
No portion of the cash flow is treated as interest-on-interest. Instead, there is a formal conversion of accrued interest to loan principal on payment dates (negative amortization).
It follows that at the end of every payment period, one should first compute the value of
“(1)” and then subtract it from the net cash flow on the payment date to obtain the correct
value of “(2).” The outstanding principal balance changes by amount “(2),” and only on payment dates, not daily.

The Bond Market Association

Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

Long-standing market practices have resulted in different methods for calculating average life
for pass-through securities (notably GPMs and payment-capped ARMs) and for CMOs.
Because of widespread acceptance of these methods within their respective market segments,
the Standard Formulas for average life are product-specific.
For GPMs and ARMs, all periodic principal payments, positive or negative, should be included in both the numerator and denominator of the average-life calculation (see Section
G.1.c.), so that the denominator equals the principal balance in effect for the period of the
settlement date (exclusive of accrued interest). For Z-bonds, the numerator and denominator
should include only the positive principal payments (amount “(2)” if positive, 0 otherwise),
and the denominator will generally be larger than the principal balance at settlement.
Example: To illustrate these points, consider the following hypothetical accrual instrument:
Time

Net
Cash Flow

10% Periodic
Interest

Principal Repayment
(= Cash Flow – Interest)

Principal
Balance

0
1

11
121

10
11
11

–10
0
110

100
110
110
0

If there is no cash-flow delay, then the average life under the GPM/ARM convention is
1( −10) + 2 (0) + 3 (110)
−10 + 0 + 110

=

320
= 3.20 periods.
100

Under the Z-bond convention, the average life is
1(0) + 2 (0) + 3 (110)
0 + 0

+ 10

=

330
= 3.00 periods.
110

The GPM/ARM definition has the advantage of preserving the intended relationship
between average life and interest-rate risk. In particular, the average life of a fixed-income
security should roughly equal the term to maturity for which a bullet with the same coupon
would have the same price-sensitivity per purchase dollar. This is the purpose for which average life is used in the absence of duration measures. In general, negative principal payments
lead to longer average lives, in some cases longer than the final maturity.
It should be noted that the Z-bond definition of average life can substantially understate the
true interest-rate sensitivity of a security, and that the combined average life of the bond
classes of a CMO containing Z-bonds can be inconsistent with the average life of the underlying collateral. Analysts and traders should be aware of these facts when average-life comparisons are being made.
2. Accrual Calculations for CMO Z-Bonds
The special calculation method for the settlement of accrual bonds has been discontinued for
trades made on or after July 15, 1991, with settlement on or after October 1, 1991.
Henceforth, these trades will follow the standards set forth in Sections F.1. and F.2.
