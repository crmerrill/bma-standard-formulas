Uniform Practices/Standard Formulas

Example:
Factor Dates - 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, etc.
Record Dates - 1/14, 2/14, 3/14, etc.
Settlement Date - 2/15 to 3/14
Accrued Interest calculation - days from Settlement Date to 3/15
(always at least one day of accrued interest)
A holder of record on 2/14 (the seller) receives principal and interest from Freddie Mac
on 3/15. The dollar amounts are determined by the following formulas, where F(m/d)
denotes the factor as of a date, FACE denotes the original face amount, and
COUPON(m/d) denotes the annual coupon rate in percent as of a date:

[

]

Principal = F (1 1) − F (2 1) * FACE,
Interest = F (1 1) * FACE * COUPON (2 15)/1200.

G. Yield and Yield-Related Measures
1. General Rules
All mortgage-related yields, durations, convexities and holding-period returns should be calculated uniformly on a semiannual-compounding basis, regardless of the frequency of the
actual cash flows used in computing these measures.* The correct computations are specified
in detail below.
a.

Bond-Equivalent Yield (or Semiannual Yield or simply Yield) is the number Y, which satisfies the equation
P =

CF1
CF2
+
+ ... ,
2T1
(1 + Y 200)
(1 + Y 200) 2T2

where P is the dollar price of the security (including the correct accrued interest), CFK
is the cash flow received by the investor at time TK after settlement (measured in years,
on a 30/360 calendar basis, including actual delay days), and the sum is over all future
cash flows K=1,2,... . Unlike the standard definitions of yield for government, municipal
and corporate bonds, the standard for mortgage-related securities is free of exceptional
cases for single- or odd-coupon periods.
b.

Mortgage Yield or Monthly Yield: If clearly labeled, yield may also be quoted on a monthly compounding basis:
Mortgage Yield = 1200

[ (1+ Y 200) − 1 ] .

* In certain instances, semiannual computations are undefined for overnight investments. These are more appropriately analyzed
using money-market formula standards.
