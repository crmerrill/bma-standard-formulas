# BMA SF-10: Conversion of One-Month PSA to SMM Based on Months after Mortgage Origination
# SMM: Single Monthly Mortality (monthly prepayment rate in percent)
# PSA: Standard Prepayment Model of The Bond Market Association
# Find the column corresponding to the ONE-MONTH PSA, and the row corresponding to loan age.
# The intersection gives the one-month equivalent SMM.
# NOTE: Do not use this table for 3-month, 1-year, or to-date PSA, as results will be inaccurate.
# NOTE: Results will be imprecise to the extent that mortgages in a pool have differing ages.
